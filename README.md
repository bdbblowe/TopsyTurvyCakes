# TopsyTurvyCakes

An online cake recipe catalog for a fictitious brand to share and manage their favorite recipes with their customers.
I experimented with Razor Pages, used the page model, managed dependencies, and secured the application.

Obstacles included:
Creating a new application
Setting up pages
Rendering dynamic content
Reusing markup with layouts
Increasing the maintainability of pages
Processing data
Validating input
Securing an application
